    the concentration of poisonous lead in the drinking water.
    The *Lead and Copper Rule* posits that if more than 10% of samples 
    are above 15 parts per billion (ppb), action is required by officials. 
    The MDEQ originally excluded two samples with high readings, 
    thus resulting in below-threshold readings overall. Suspicious of the results,
    a citizen science project coordinated by Prof. Marc Edwards and 
    colleagues at Virginia Tech collected 271 new samples, 
    which pointed to generally higher levels of lead concentration than the official 
    MDEQ data had suggested.  \n\nThe plot below shows the distribution of samples 
    in relation to the 10% threshold when each dataset is 
    resampled 10,000 times using bootstrapping (the MDEQ data bootstrapped both with and 
    without the samples originally excluded). When including the originally excluded 
    samples, both datasets would indicate that the Flint drinking water is likely to contain
    **dangerous levels of lead** at a rate which would require official action 
    for public safety.",
